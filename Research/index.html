	<h1>Research Interest</h1>

	<p>My research expertise lies in the field of artificial intelligence technology. I have a strong background in designing and implementing algorithms for artificial intelligence, computer vision, and digital signal processing. In addition to producing numerous theoretical contributions to artificial intelligence, I have also collaborated with diverse individuals and teams across various research fields, such as medical image processing, soft robotics, civil engineering, industrial defect detection, and so on. I am also open to exploring new research areas if given the opportunity.</p>
<h5>Project: Weird-Net: Weighted Relative Distance Attention for Efficient and Robust Sequence Processing</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>11&#x2F;2022 – 06&#x2F;2023</strong></span><em>Research leader</em><br>I examined self-attention mechanisms and the challenges they face in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these challenges, I proposed and designed a Weighted Relative Distance (Weird) Attention algorithm and a Weird-Net model that can capture positional inductive relationships with lower complexity and higher robustness than Transformer-based models. I evaluated the performance of Weird-Net on five datasets and demonstrated its superiority over Transformer-based models in accuracy, complexity, and robustness.</p>

<h5>Project: Category Knowledge-Guided Few-Shot Bearing Fault Diagnosis</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>02&#x2F;2023-Present</strong></span><em>Project Leader</em><br>I proposed a novel framework, Category Knowledge as a Guide (CKG), for cross-domain fault diagnosis and early fault detection of rotating machinery. The CKG framework can extract category features from few-shot data and classify them into different domains. I designed and evaluated an algorithm based on the CKG framework and verified its performance experimentally.</p>

<h5>Project: Cuneate Recurrent Neural Network</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>10&#x2F;2022 – 08&#x2F;2023</strong></span><em>Research leader</em><br>I proposed and developed the Cuneate Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), a novel model that adds a cuneate layer to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to enhance information extraction and reduce memory decay. I demonstrated that CRNN can handle long signal sequence lengths better than other RNN models, by conducting experiments on various datasets involving music, image, text, and bearing classification.</p>

<h5>Ultron: A High-Performance Sequence-Processing Model Based on the Composite Mapping Layer</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>06&#x2F;2023 – 09&#x2F;2023</strong></span><em>Research leader</em></p>
<p>I designed and implemented Ultron, a novel sequence-processing model that efficiently handles long-range dependencies by using a composite mapping function with O(Llog2L) complexity. I conducted experiments on four datasets to compare Ultron with other Transformer-based models and demonstrate its advantages in terms of accuracy, generalization, efficiency, and memory consumption. I also prepared and wrote a research paper that reported the project’s methods, results, and conclusions.</p>

<h5>Project: Neighborhood Correlation Enhancement Network for PCB Defect Classification, 

<p>Collaborative Network of Multi-view Graph Disentanglement for PCB Defect Classification</p>
</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>09&#x2F;2021–Present</strong></span><em>Project Leader</em><br>The project aimed to identify and classify defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs) using computer vision techniques and neural networks. I developed a visual matching algorithm that aligned defect maps and standard maps of PCBs with pixel accuracy. I proposed a Collaborative Network of Multi-view Graph Disentanglement (AMTCN) for PCB Defect Classification, which was designed to reduce computational complexity and improve the detection of similarities between functional and non-functional defect textures, as well as small defects. Our experimental comparison concluded that AMTCN achieved superior defect identification accuracy, minimal FLOPs, and Params with HRIPCB compared to 13 advanced models.</p>

<h5>Project: Shear performance of high-strength friction-grip bolted shear connector in prefabricated steel-UHPC composite beams: Finite element modelling and parametric study</h5>

<p><span style="float:right"><strong>04&#x2F;2022-01&#x2F;2023</strong></span><em>Project Leader</em><br>I performed finite element analysis on the mechanical behavior and performance of high-strength friction-grip bolts (HSFGBs) and prefabricated ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) slabs. I applied data analysis techniques to assess the outcomes and contrast them with existing methods.</p>
